      <h1>ABOUT THE BUS</h1>
      <p>Whether you stay for a night or the weekend, your experience will be totally different than what you would expect at a hotel on Mt. Hood. You'll be part of a tight-knit community of authentic people looking for real connection and a kickass time. For us, this is about building a network of people that can come together and bond over snow sports--all are welcome.</p><br>
      <h3>WHAT IS INCLUDED?</h3>
      <p>We're just getting started so for now the ammenities are limited. If you have any good ideas or suggestions, absolutely let us know and we'll try to build that into the experience!</p>

        <li>Bedding: freshly washed sleeping bag, pillow, and pillow case</li>
        <li>Storage: personal containers for each guest as well as storage space in the back of the bus as well as below the bunks. There are also lockers under half of the bottom bunks</li>
